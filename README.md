# C-SharpProjects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

# Projects:

Car Insurance

Shipping Quote

# Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

# Shipping Quote
This is a console application that simulates a shipping quote program. It takes the user's input 
based on dimensions associated with their packages and provides a quote based on set prices. This also 
includes a check in order to determine if the package can even be shipped based on the information given.
