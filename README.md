# C-SharpProjects

This file was created to show a few of the projects I have created 
using C# and the .Net Framework and to show my progress and the growth
I have made. This repository is filled with my C# work which ranges from 
Console Applications, Web Applications, and MVC ideology.

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

# Projects:

Car Insurance

Shipping Quote

# Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

# Shipping Quote
This is a console application that simulates a shipping quote program. It takes the user's input 
based on dimensions associated with their packages and provides a quote based on set prices. This also 
includes a check in order to determine if the package can even be shipped based on the information given.
